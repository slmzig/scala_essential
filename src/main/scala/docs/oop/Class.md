##### defining a class
- class is a blueprint for class instances
- we can then create new objects (instances) from the class
- we can define class with a `class` keyword
```scala
class Person
```

##### creating instance of class
- you can create an instance of a class with keyword `new`
```scala
  val person = new Person()
```

##### constructor of class
