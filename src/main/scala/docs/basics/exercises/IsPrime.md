How to prove a prime value

prime value can be devided only:
- by itself
- by 1

some facts:
- 0 and 1 are not considered prime numbers.
- 2 is prime values because it can be divided by 2 and 1
- Any number greater than 5 that can be divided by 5 is not prime

how to prove number is not a prime:
- try to divide number by 2 to get whole number
- if you dont get a whole number next subtract number by 1 something like n - 1 = t
- next do n % t repeat it until you get a whole value (number is prime) or 1 (number is not prime)
